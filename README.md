CODE PLAGIARISM CHECKER
Code plagiarism means using another personâ€™s source code and claiming it as their own
and plagiarism in source code for computers is also very common. Code plagiarism
detection is the process of locating instances of plagiarism within a code. My program
will detect code clones among multiple source codes from a folder. The source codes
must be written in C. The output will indicate the files that may have been copied from
the same source code.
